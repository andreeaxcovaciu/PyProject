## Introduction
  A lot of women worldwide are infertility problems or undesired pregnancies. The number of abortions is really high so in order 
to prevent such a situation, this work is suggesting a useful way in birth control. Monitoring the level of estrogen in womanâ€™s body can say a lot of their menstrual cycle. The method proposed is the usage of saliva analysis. Above that, there can exist different health problems as infectious diseases, systemic diseases, digestive problems induced by many viruses as Hepatitis virus, herpes virus, Ebola virus, cytomegalovirus. They could be detected in this way but also through invasive or noninvasive methods. The main purpose is to make this situation easier, cheaper and more accessible for everyone. This being said, saliva analysis is a step ahead to accomplish that.

Furthermore, I will present my approach according to the problem.

## Implementation

### Image acquisition
Saliva samples were collected every morning and pictures were taken using a microscope and its camera. After that, the second step was to process those samples. Here you have some samples from the database.
